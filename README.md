This is a group email list that we'll use for class communication in both my sections of CG-214 this Spring. <br/>

The purpose of this list is for course-related announcements, discussion and questions. Feel free to share web-related links, articles and inspiration. This is also a great place to ask questions about what you're working on or things you're struggling with technically. You may of course email me individually, but most likely someone else in the class has the same question so it's a great way to learn from each other.<br/>

We'll use it as a group across both sections 102 and 103. I will communicate section-specific announcements separately.<br/>

# Course Description 

This 15-week course introduces students to the basics of web design and programming for the web. Students will work primarily with HTML and CSS to build the structural and visual components of a website, using CSS to integrate interaction and animation. In the second half of the semester, students will be introduced to other libraries for responsive design (Bootstrap) and languages (JavaScript) to create more complex, interactive websites.

<b>By the end of the course, students should be able to:</b>
* Write HTML to create the structural foundation of a website, and use it at an intermediate level
* Style websites with CSS, and make websites dynamic with CSS transitions 
* Create a unique website based on their own designs and visual ideas, considering key aspects of visual systems, interaction and user experience
* Debug their work and know how to search for necessary documentation or supplemental information
* Use Github and Github Pages to post homework
* Know the basic technical vocabulary of the front-end web, so that they can pursue more advanced web programming; this includes understanding the relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript and being able to read the HTML / CSS of other websites using browser’s developer tools
* Incorporate libraries such as Bootstrap to create responsive designs
* Develop a critical vocabulary for looking at and talking about web experiences<br/>
<br/>

# Work and Requirements
<h3>Course Deliverables</h3>
<b>1. Weekly Homework</b><br/>
Each week you’ll have a homework assignment that requires mastery of the material we covered in class the week before. These will be primarily design and technical exercises, with an occasional reading assignment. 

<b>2. Presentation: Website Design Review (1 person per week)</b><br/>
Every student will have to give an individual 7-10 minute presentation on a website that you feel is interesting, groundbreaking and innovative. You’ll talk about the design, concept, messaging, navigation and usability.

There will be at least 1 student presenting per week, depending on the number of students in the class. 

[SIGN UP LINK HERE - 1 per each section]

<b>3. Midterm Project</b><br/>
Your midterm project will be a website responding to one of the following assignment prompts:
* An interactive self portrait
* A piece of hypertext narrative
* A redesign of an existing site
There will be a set of additional technical requirements you must meet for this assignment, to be reviewed later in the semester.

<b>4. Final Project</b><br/>
Your final project will be full-scale website design and implementation that can either be a development of your midterm or a portfolio site for yourself. Unlike the midterm, which is a shorter assignment, we will go through a full design process of sketching, wireframing, designing and then building out this site.

<h3>Attendance</h3>
Attendance is mandatory and will be taken at the beginning of each class.

This class meets for 1 hour and 50 minutes per week. We have a ton of material to cover, so come on time.  Students who come in later than 30 minutes after the class started will be marked absent.

<b>If you know in advance that you will not be able to attend a class, email me beforehand.</b>

* 3 unexcused latenesses = one absence. 
* 3 unexcused absences = one half grade decrease (e.g. an A becomes an A-). 
* More than 3 unexcused absences a student will receive a failing grade.
